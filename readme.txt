This is the game of TORN! (Not to be mistake with Tron, it's totally different.)
There are two players, Blue and Red.
Blue is controled with the arrow keys and Red is controled with WASD.
The goal is to defeat your opponent by making them run into the wall or into the trail you've left behind.
May the best cyclist win!
